# General Projects

This repository is a collection of various projects I’ve worked on across different topics and technologies. It’s a bit of a mixed bag — from data science experiments to coding practice and exploratory analyses.

## What’s Inside

- Diverse scripts, notebooks, and mini-projects.
- Explorations in data science, statistics, and programming.
- Examples of problem-solving and learning new tools.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/jay10440/general-projects.git
2. Browse folders or files that catch your interest.
3. Run scripts or notebooks in your environment to see the work in action.

## Notes

- This is an evolving space where I try new things and build skills.
- Some projects might be rough or incomplete—still learning and experimenting.
- Open to suggestions or collaboration if something sparks your interest!
